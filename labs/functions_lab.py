# **Exercise 1**
# Create a function called age_calculator that takes in two parameters (Two different years) and returns the difference of the two years:

def age_calculator(year1, year2):
  # TODO: add your code below. Remove the word "pass" when complete 

  pass


print(age_calculator(2018, 1900))  #output to terminal should be 118





# **Exercise 2**
# Define another function, avg_numbers that takes three parameters, that returns the average of three numbers.


def avg_numbers(x, y, z):
  # TODO: add your code below. Remove the word "pass" when complete 

  pass

print(avg_numbers(4, 7, 8)) #output should be 6.33333333
